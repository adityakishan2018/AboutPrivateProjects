The aim of this project is to build a web based health care application which can help in early and appropriate disease diagnosis. This in turn is expected to cut down the amount spent on general physician.This is a summer project done at VIT-AP University for 8 credits.
Recently added a chatbot named "DocBot" which I built using AWS Lex.Presently, this chatbot can be used to book appointments at hospital after the disease is diagnosed.This is just for demo purpose.No real booking is done.
