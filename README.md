Simple Coffee Ordering web application using AWS Lex. Registration and Login part is yet to be included( not a big deal though). Also working on including ML based predictor which will tell whether they are fit to drink coffee or not.

# CrypTalk
Web application for customized message encryption(only for a single organisation which requires secure message platform).This is a mini project done for ISS (Information and System Security) course at VIT-AP University.

# DocTalk | Self-Health-Monitoring
The aim of this project is to build a web based health care application which can help in early and appropriate disease diagnosis. This in turn is expected to cut down the amount spent on general physician.This is a summer project done at VIT-AP University for 8 credits.
Recently added a chatbot named "DocBot" which I built using AWS Lex.Presently, this chatbot can be used to book appointments at hospital after the disease is diagnosed.This is just for demo purpose.No real booking is done.

# DocBot | ML based disease predictor and Hospital booking Web App
This can be considered as an upgraded version of my previous project "DocTalk".The addressed problem is more or less same but the prediction algorithm has changed drastically. In this app we feed the user input to a well trained ML model.Then the model will spit out the predicted diagnosis result.The chatbot named "DocBot" was first used in this application.Later on I thought of including in its predecessor app (DocBot).
Right now I am working on improving its UI and ML model acuuracy.
